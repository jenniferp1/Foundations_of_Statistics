#Primary Research Question
#For artists age 30 or older, do female artists play different 
#kinds of music on Austin City Limits than male artists?

#who was over 60 years of age

#Verify Country given Female P(Country|F) -- see twoway output
#P(Country and F) = 6/102
#P(F) = 25/102
#using equation
(6/102)/(25/102)

#there are 6 in F/Country box, Tot_F = 6+4+8+7=25

# Proportion of jazz performers male (gender given genre)

# Proportion of males that preform jazz (genre given gender)
